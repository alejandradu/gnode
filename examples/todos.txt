0. send vanilla on 3bff - ONGOING
0. plot metrics of past experiments - get optimal node DONE
00. send gru, node on 2bff - DONE (trained in < 1h for optimized)
1. code the 2bitmem task - DONE

2. send train node, gru, vanilla on 2bitmem - ONGOING 
- fix to always overwrite dataset until it is right
- dimensions have to agree in 3D

2a. send vanilla on 2bff with optim params
3. code fixed point to analyze past nodes
4. analyze fixed point for node, gru, vanilla on 3bff
5. plot flow field on gru, node, vanilla on 3bff

6. optimize node, gru, vanilla on 2bitmem
